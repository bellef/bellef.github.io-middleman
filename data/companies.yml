    - At <strong>Le Wagon</strong> coding bootcamp, I can help people who want to make a big change in their lives.
    - Le Wagon is a 9 weeks intense coding bootcamp where people learn how to move from an idea to a real product by using modern tools including HTML/CSS/JS, Ruby/Rails, Git, Heroku, etc.
      Teaching is a good way for me to question what I've learned, become better and learn from people of different backgrounds.
